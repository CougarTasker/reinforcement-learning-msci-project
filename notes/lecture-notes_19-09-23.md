dave and Argyrios are the Final Year Project (FYP) committee

they are not our markers they are here to help 

general questions should be in the forum 

# project plan

use project plan template

always check the marking grids for the criteria to meet 

## dave's wisdom


supervisor -> employer / employee relationship

supervisor will
 - guide my reading 
 - evaluate my work 
 - help with difficulties

I need to: 
 - attend progress meeting
 - **keep a diary**
   - once a week
   - our thoughts 
   - do we need to record time spent? 
 - write reports and programmes 
 - use the private GitLab they have provided 


progress meetings: one per term 

 - 20 mins 
 - bring the diary
 - prepare for the meeting
   - bring everything 
 - take notes 

10 hours per week on the project 

- work to a plan 
- writing up as you go 
- keep saving work as you go 
- keep diary as we go (it is marked)
- take notes as you go 
- keep track of tasks (trello my todos)


need to write about professional issues in the final report (ethics)



plan 

why are we doing the project 

what have wee read that will help us

what tasks we we complete, when (start/end) and why will I do them 
what are the risks 



## december review 


we need to give a 10 minuet presentation:
 - our technical achievements 
 - programs we have written 
 - important theory or algorithms 

early deliverables are the building blocks of the interim report which is the building blocks of the final report

## final submission 

 -  a live demonstration of our code 
 - a final report 
 - programs or other deliverables 
 - technical achievements 
 - understanding of professional issues

to avoid zero marks we must have:

 - completed the diary submitted with the final report 


initial meeting -> arrange a meeting with the supervisor for next week 

minimum of three mattings with the supervisor 


aim for at least 15 references
