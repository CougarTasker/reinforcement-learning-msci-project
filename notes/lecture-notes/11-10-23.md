# Git and GitLab

use gitlab and add a diary that we need to edit at minimum twice a week 

 - even though we are working alone we should use feature branches:
   - main is always a working copy of the code
 - commit regularly
 - we cannot force push or rebase gitlab history
 - by using gitlab our work is backed up 
 - if we are unable to submit our gitlab repo can be marked

> use merge `--no-fast-forward` so we keep the branch history 

- use git ignore to avoid adding files that should not be seen
  - e.g. files that are derived 
  - rubbish that dave does not need to see
- use git credential manager
