# project plan 

7-10 pages -> ideal 

no more than 15 

abstract 
 - 2-3 pages 
 - 

risk and mitigations 

 - what risks are specific to my project 


references (bibliography)

 - most professional part
 - example 
   - if we want to read about a new language we can use the documentation as a reference
 - find one reference and find its references they can be referenced in out project
   - use them in the abstract 


## citing 

on google scholar get the citation -> in bibtex it can be added to the biography in tex

tex seems to be preferred, there is a template for these FYP. 


10-15 are more than enough references 

## Deviating from the project plan 

if the project plan was unreasonable you might be penalised 

if the project plan was reasonable but you deviate to make the project (e.g. for un-forseen reasons) better then we wont be penalised
