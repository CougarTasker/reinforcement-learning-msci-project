# How to implement testing 

tests in javascript typically are placed next to the next to the source code

the tests declare what we expect the code to do. and be a simple as possible.

TDD cannot be added in at the end it must be followed throughout the development

group relevant tests together

## Unit testing

mock data and functionally of other units so you are only testing one part of the application at one time. 

## End to end testing 

applications like cypress can allow you to automate using the application to automatically check for bugs across the whole application

## Pipelines 

automated tests like the above can be automated to run on git actions such as branches being made or pull requests
