questions:

I am unsure about the required reports they seem separate an unmentioned in the mark scheme and stuff i have seen mentioned about the report

where should I include these reports, do they belong in the report?

are they marked? yes under the background section

provide evidence of the software Engineering -> screenshots +  code listing

expand on the differences between supervised learning and reinforcement learning in the abstract

generate the html documentation files

focus on the presentation -> include program video
