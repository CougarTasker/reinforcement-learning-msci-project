# Fourth meeting 

project has come along but the deadlines are looking tight, 

graphics -> 
- graphs can be done in `matplotlib` but they can require some work to get them looking right
- look at standard approaches for displaying value tables and policies

report is close to including final deliverables in some capacity:
 - If i can lean into this I can get a better grade
 - need to include results from program
