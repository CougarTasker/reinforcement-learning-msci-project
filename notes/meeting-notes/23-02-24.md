# Supervisor meeting 3

I have added functionality to visualising the effects of different hyper parameters

implemented random search.

adapted the MF-BPI strategy, from the github been working on clearing up unused variables and making it more readable


needs tuning but getting my head around it

todo: implemented forked river-swim , current environments are not stochastic

then I want to focus on writing up this report on this work

question: What is a good measure of exploration, best policy identification?
